<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since the success of deep learning, where it outperforms almost every machine learning task including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, representation learning and many more. Even after so many years after it first shone like a charm, there lies many subtle mysterious regarding theoretical aspects of deep learning which revolves around the questions dealing with generalization, memorization, regularization, hidden representations and many more such mind-boggling paradoxes. Many great researchers have put forward their views and perspectives on how to approach towards a theoretical framework for deep learning which has explanations and interpretations of what we observe in practice while training a deep learning model. One of the most promising ideas which is there for quite some time now is the application of information theory in deep learning using which researchers have shown interesting state-of-the-art results comparable to results from standard practices in deep learning. One such idea borrowed from information theory is ‘Information Bottleneck’ principle (IB) proposed by Prof. Naftali Tishby which give some hope for theoretically measure generalization and compression ability of a model. One of the key ideas of IB theory is its ability to define optimal representations even for intermediate hidden layers and this idea of regularizing intermediate representations have got much of the attention from all the researcher in the field. Since then many new measures and robust IB objective functions is proposed, all exploiting the above idea of regularization. PyGlow is the first library of its kind in the sense it provides a complete ecosystem for researchers working in this field by facilitating them with all the information theoretic methods they require while experimenting their ideas and hypothesis based on IB theory.</p>

<h2>Intended Audience<a class="headerlink" href="#intended-audience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The intended audience for this package is really anyone who is willing to look beyond a traditional way of doing deep learning. The aim is to provide any deep learning enthusiast with a set of tools which she/he can use to open the black box of deep learning. From past two years, information theory have shown to give interesting insights into the theoretical studies of neural network dynamics. But no standard package existed before this which can really fill this gap of standard deep learning and this budding field of information theory in deep learning. There are researchers from all over the world publishing their awesome results in the field and now it’s the perfect time for a library like PyGlow to get introduced itself to the researchers out there. Hence intended audience also include researchers which are or is interested to work in this field and this spirit of offering ease to them in their research work is reflected in the API structure of PyGlow.</p>

<p>Let’s run your first PyGlow code.
First verify that it’s installed successfully on your system by running the following command in the interpreter.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">glow</span>

<p>PyGlow is a community project, hence all contributions are more than
welcome!</p>
<div class="section" id="bug-reporting">
<h3>Bug reporting<a class="headerlink" href="#bug-reporting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Not only things break all the time, but also different people have different
use cases for the project. If you find anything that doesn’t work as expected
or have suggestions, please refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/spino17/PyGlow/issues">issue tracker</a> on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h3>Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Documentation can always be improved and made easier to understand for
newcomers. The docs are stored in text files under the <cite>docs/source</cite>
directory, so if you think anything can be improved there please edit the
files and proceed in the same way as with <a class="reference internal" href="#code-writing">code writing</a>.</p>
<p>The Python classes and methods also feature inline docs: if you detect
any inconsistency or opportunity for improvement, you can edit those too.</p>
<p>Besides, the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/spino17/PyGlow/wiki">wiki</a> is open for everybody to edit, so feel free to add
new content.</p>
<p>To build the docs, you must first create a development environment (see
below) and then in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docs/</span></code> directory run:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> docs
$ make html
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After this, the new docs will be inside <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build/html</span></code>. You can open
them by running an HTTP server:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> build/html
$ python -m http.server
Serving HTTP on <span class="m">0</span>.0.0.0 port <span class="m">8000</span> ...
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And point your browser to <a class="reference external" href="http://0.0.0.0:8000">http://0.0.0.0:8000</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-writing">
<h3>Code writing<a class="headerlink" href="#code-writing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Code contributions are welcome! If you are looking for a place to start,
help us fixing bugs in einsteinpy and check out the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/spino17/PyGlow/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">“easy” tag</a>. Those
should be easier to fix than the others and require less knowledge about the
library.</p>
<p>If you are hesitant on what IDE or editor to use, just choose one that
you find comfortable and stick to it while you are learning. People have
strong opinions on which editor is better so I recommend you to ignore
the crowd for the time being - again, choose one that you like :)</p>
<p>If you ask me for a recommendation, I would suggest Spyder (good for machine learning)
or PyCharm (complete IDE, free and gratis, RAM-hungry) or vim (powerful editor, very
lightweight, steep learning curve). Other people use Spyder, emacs, gedit, Notepad++,
Sublime, Atom…</p>
<p>You will also need to understand how git works. git is a decentralized
version control system that preserves the history of the software, helps
tracking changes and allows for multiple versions of the code to exist
at the same time. If you are new to git and version control, I recommend
following <a class="reference external" href="https://try.github.io/">the Try Git tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>If you already know how all this works and would like to contribute new
features then that’s awesome! Before rushing out though please make sure it
is within the scope of the library so you don’t waste your time -
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:bhavyabhatt17&#37;&#52;&#48;gmail&#46;com">email</a> us.</p>
<p>If the feature you suggest happens to be useful and within scope, you will
probably be advised to create a new <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/spino17/PyGlow/wiki">wiki</a> page with some information
about what problem you are trying to solve, how do you plan to do it and
a sketch or idea of how the API is going to look like. You can go there
to read other good examples on how to do it. The purpose is to describe
without too much code what you are trying to accomplish to justify the
effort and to make it understandable to a broader audience.</p>
<p>All new features should be thoroughly tested, and in the ideal case the
coverage rate should increase or stay the same. Automatic services will ensure
your code works on all the operative systems and package combinations
PyGlow support - specifically, note that PyGlow is a Python 3 only
library.</p>

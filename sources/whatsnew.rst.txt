What's New ?
============


- PyGlow will provide support for HSIC sigma network (yes models that train without back-prop !) in its next version (currently base implementation of HSIC is available, for more details visit notebooks_).

.. _notebooks: https://github.com/spino17/PyGlow/tree/master/docs/source/examples/

- Some more mutual information estimators and other robust criterion will also be available which are currently been used in the research community.


- More implementations related to IB-based training paradigms would be available including variational information bottleneck encoders and much more.



So stay tuned smart people, there is a lot to come in future !

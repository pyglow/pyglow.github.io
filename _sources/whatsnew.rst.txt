What's New ?
============


- PyGlow will provide support for HSIC sigma network (yes models that train without back-prop !) in its next version (currently base implementation of HSIC is available, for more details visit Jupyter Notebooks).
- Some more mutual information estimators and other robust criterion will also be available which are currently been used in the research community.
- More implementations related to IB-based training paradigms would be available including variational information bottleneck encoders and much more.

So stay tuned smart people, there is a lot to come in future !
